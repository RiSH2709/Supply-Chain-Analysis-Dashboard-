# Supply-Chain-Analysis-Dashboard
Welcome to the Supply Chain Dashboard Project! 🚚📦 This interactive dashboard allows users to visualize, analyze, and generate actionable insights on key supply chain metrics such as order fulfillment, inventory levels, and lead times.

🌟 Project Overview
This project aims to provide an interactive, user-friendly platform for supply chain professionals and analysts. With real-time visualizations, users can easily track the status of their supply chain processes, identify inefficiencies, and make data-driven decisions.

Key Features:

📊 Data Visualizations: Interactive charts to track supply chain metrics.
📉 Trend Analysis: Visualize and analyze trends in lead times, inventory, and orders.
⚙️ Real-Time Insights: Generate insights that help optimize the supply chain process.
☁️ Web-based Dashboard: Deployed for easy access through Streamlit.

🔗 Supply Chain Dashboard

This dashboard is interactive, and users can explore different supply chain data metrics such as inventory, orders, and lead times.

Contents:
Source Code:
- The Streamlit app (app.py) which hosts the interactive dashboard.
- Python code for generating and displaying visualizations.
Dataset:
extended_supply_chain_data_3000.csv: The raw and cleaned datasets used to generate the dashboard's charts and tables.
Google Colab Notebook:
supplychaintest.ipynb: The notebook used to clean and process the data before being visualized in the dashboard.
Requirements File:
requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries needed to run the project. Use this file to quickly set up a local environment.

🖥️ Technologies Used
Streamlit: A Python framework for building interactive web applications.
Python: Programming language used to develop the dashboard and perform data analysis.
Google Colab: Cloud-based Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, transformations, and processing.
Plotly/Matplotlib: Libraries for creating interactive visualizations and charts.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.

Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RiSH2709/Supply-Chain-Analysis-Dashboard-
2. Create a Virtual Environment
We recommend creating a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
3. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
cd supply-chain-dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Streamlit Dashboard
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Streamlit app with the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
This will open the dashboard in your default web browser, where you can explore the interactive visualizations.
